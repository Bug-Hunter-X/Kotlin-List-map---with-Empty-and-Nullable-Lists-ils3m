# Kotlin List map() Behavior with Empty and Nullable Lists

This example shows how Kotlin's `map()` function handles empty and nullable lists.  It's important to understand this behavior to avoid unexpected results or runtime exceptions.

The `BuggyMap.kt` file contains the original code, demonstrating the expected behavior.  The `FixedMap.kt` file is not necessary in this case because the original code is already correct and handles edge cases effectively. The example highlights the robust nature of Kotlin's collection processing functions.

The key takeaway is that `map()` on an empty list produces an empty list, and `map()` on a null list produces null, avoiding common errors seen in other languages.
